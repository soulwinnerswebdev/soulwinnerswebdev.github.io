            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Welcome to the Soulwinners Ministries International website. Before you peruse the rest of the site, please soberly consider the following:</strong><div><br></div><div><strong>Relatively soon you will die. Your body will decompose, but your spirit will go to God to be judged for how you lived on earth (Ecclesiastes 12:7). And God will judge every second of your life (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14, Hebrews 9:27).</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>If you have ever lied, you have broken the 9th Commandment of God’s Law; you are a liar and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone (Revelation 21:8). If you have ever had a sexual thought about anyone besides your husband or your wife, you have broken God’s 7th Commandment; you are a fornicator, an adulterer, and  neither adulterers nor fornicators shall inherit the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). If you have ever had anger or hatred in your heart towards anybody, you have broken God’s 6th Commandment; you are a murderer in danger of hellfire (1 John 3:15, Matthew 5:22). If you have ever focused on anything more than you have focused on God, you have broken God’s 1st Commandment, you are an idolator and  idolators shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone (Revelation 21:8). If you have formed, or accepted, in your mind, a god, or higher power, that fits your personal beliefs and lifestyle, you have broken God’s 2nd Commandment by making a graven image. If you have spoken God’s Name to express anything besides devotion, you have broken God’s 3rd Commandment; you have taken the Lord’s Name in vain and will not be guiltless. If you have ever neglected to devote one entire day out of the week to do nothing except worship, praise, and thank God, you have broken God’s 4th Commandment; you are a Sabbath-breaker. If you have ever neglected to give money to, or, obey, your parents, you have broken God’s 5th Commandment; you have not honored your parents. If you have ever desired anything that belonged to somebody else, you have broken God’s 10th Commandment; you are covetous. If you have ever taken something that did not belong to you, you have broken God’s 8th Commandment; you are a thief and thieves shall not inherit the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:10).</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>More specifically:</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Every time that you: acted selfishly, hated others, were jealous of others, were prejudiced against others, harbored sexual desire towards anyone that you were not married to, disobeyed your parents or guardians, spent more time focused on material things than on God, spoke God’s Name without respect, neglected to spend one out of every seven days in unbroken prayer, praise, thanksgiving and Bible Study to God, murdered people physically or inwardly through your dislike for and slander of them, looked with sexual desire at people whom you weren’t married to (a male husband with a female wife), kissed, fondled, had sex with anyone that you were not married to, took anything or anyone that did not belong to you, lied or intended to deceive anyone, desired anything or anyone that did not belong to you, masturbated, looked at pornography, engaged in homosexual or lesbian sex, had sex with animals, raped anyone, molested children, lived for pleasure, desired, worked, prayed, for monetary wealth, spent more time working for money than studying the Bible and praying, participated in Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Bahaism, Shintoism, Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witness, Satanism, Wicca, paganism, witchcraft, Rosicrucianism, Judaism, New Age, animism, shamanism, magic, Klu Klux Klan, Black Panthers, nationalism, patriotism, or any belief system besides the Bible belief in Jesus Christ as the only Lord, God and Savior of mankind, drank alcohol, smoked cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, pipes, used marijuana, cocaine, crack, crank, heroin, meta-amphetamine, or any other drug, spent more time playing or watching sports, watching TV, movies, videos, DVDs, becoming physically fit, attempting to lose weight, listening to music, working on a business, working on a ministry, attending a building called a church, doing school work, sleeping, eating, cooking, cleaning, working, walking, talking on the phone, working on the computer, surfing the internet, spending time with family, or anything else, than loving, obeying, praying to, studying the Bible about, telling others about , the Lord Jesus Christ, you have sinned against God, broken His Laws, and will be cast into the Lake of Fire as punishment for your selfish and rebellious choice to live to please yourself, instead of living to Biblically love, obey, and please Christ, and serve your fellow human beings.</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Your sin has separated you from God, eternally. Nothing that you can do, on your own, can erase the sins that you have already committed and bring you into a relationship with the Holy, Sinless, Almighty God.</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Because you have broken God’s Law (sinned), God has blotted you out of His Book of Life (Exodus 32:33). You will die (Ezekiel 18:4). Then you will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:15).</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>But God sent His only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible, to earth, to live a life without sin, die on the cross, and rise from the dead, as a Substitute for you and your sinful life, so that your sin can be removed. For this to occur, however, you must think differently about, feel sorrow for, and stop, breaking God’s Law, choose to admit and confess all of your sins to God, stop committing them forever, ask the Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible to save you from your sins, surrender complete control of your life to Christ, who died on the cross and was raised from the dead to pay the penalty for your crimes against God- renounce sin, satan, and self, forever, commit your life to loving, obeying, and serving Christ as your Master by daily reading His Word, the Bible, and obeying it, for the rest of your life.</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Remember, soon you will die and be judged by God. If you have committed one or more sins you are guilty. Are you ready to be cast into the Lake of Fire, forever?</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>If you have questions or would like more information, please feel free to contact Soulwinners Ministries International at soulwinner@soul-winners.org.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div></div>
